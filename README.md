## Observations of the results

The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

The goal of this analysis is to compare the Capomulin treatment with other drugs. After calculating the summary statistics, I can conclude that Capomulin has the following results: the mean tumor volume (in mm³) is 40.67, and the median is 41.55. There is not much difference between these values, indicating that the data is likely symmetric.

The variance of the tumor volume is 24.94, which shows how spread out the data is around the mean. The higher the variance, the more variable the tumor volume is with the treatment. The standard deviation is 4.99, meaning that Capomulin has less variability in tumor volume compared to other drugs. The standard error of the mean (SEM) is 0.32, which indicates that when the SEM decreases or is lower, the sample mean is likely to be a more accurate estimate of the population mean.

As observed in the bar chart, Capomulin has the highest number of time points (in days), followed by the Ramicane treatment in second place and Ketapril in third place.

In the line chart of the Capomulin treatment for mouse I509, the highest tumor volume was recorded on day 20, with the tumor reaching nearly 50 mm³. By day 35, the tumor volume decreased to 41 mm³.

In the pie chart, the distribution of gender is nearly equal, with a high percentage of the population being male (50.4%) and female (49.6%).

The lower quartile of tumor volume is 47.208, the upper quartile is 56.801, and the interquartile range is 9.593. The median tumor volume is 51.776. Values below 32.881 could be outliers, while values above 71.190 could also be considered outliers.

Lastly, the correlation between mouse weight and average tumor volume is 0.53.
